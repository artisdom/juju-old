# JuJu
**JuJu**: the universal GNU/Linux package manager.

## Description
**JuJu** is a package manager that can be used for every GNU/Linux distribution.

JuJu is able to get the packages from the ArchLinux Official and AUR repositories and install them
directly in your home directory (by default is ~/.juju/).

You can choose to install the package using either the pre-compiled packages or from the source code. The available
pre-compiled packages are for i686 and x86\_64 architectures (in the future also armv{5,6,7} for your raspberry pi ;) ).
JuJu was designed to be a lightweight program written completely in bash in order to get compatibility with many systems.

There are several reasons to use JuJu instead of a traditional package manager. I just want to mention few of them:

1. Consider to have a server in production which run an important service. Generally,
    it is better to keep the system has to be as simple as possible without installing further packages as root.
    With JuJu you can install your packages in your own folder directory without affecting the performance or stability of your
    system.
2. You can create your own GNU/Linux distribution from scratch. You can follow the Linux from Scratch guide
    (http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/) and install each packages mentioned into the guide using JuJu.
3. JuJu is a weak dependency package manager that allow the user to choose if the package dependencies need to be installed.
4. To get easily your vim plugins, python libraries and more for every host you are logged in.

## Quickstart
After installing JuJu (See next section) install/remove a package like `tcpdump` is extremely easy.
Type the following:

To install tcpdump:

    $> juju -i tcpdump

To install tcpdump starting from the source code:

    $> juju -i -s tcpdump

For listing the packages already installed:

    $> juju -l
    tcpdump

For removing completely tcpdump from JuJu:

    $> juju -r tcpdump

Find out more options by typing:

    $> juju --help

Execute your program:

    $> sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 'tcp and dst port 80'
    $> man tcpdump

Wowww!

For the moment it is not implemented the functionality for searching packages. Anyway, you can search for
packages going directly to the ArchLinux website Official https://www.archlinux.org/packages/ and AUR
https://aur.archlinux.org/ repositories.

## Installation
Clone JuJu in ~/.jujup directory:

    $> git clone git://github.com/fsquillace/juju ~/.jujup

Source jujuenv or place the following line in your .bashrc file:

    $> source ~/.jujup/lib/juju/jujuenv

The 'jujuenv' file is used to get updated most of the environment variables such as PATH, LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH,
    MANPATH, etc. It also update the variables PYTHONPATH and VIMRUNTIME to get easily your favourite python libraries and
    vim plugins.

## Advanced use
If you want to place the packages in a particular folder different from the default one (~/.juju),
   type the following:

    $> JUJU_PACKAGE_HOME=<new_destination_folder> juju -i <package_name>

When JuJu installs a package it first creates a temporary directory in /tmp/juju.XXXXXX for buiding the package.
After installing the package the temporary directory is automatically removed. If you want to keep the temporary directory for debugging
purposes just type:

    $> JUJU_DEBUG=1 juju -i <package_name>

## Troubleshooting

1. Why don't I see the command if I use sudo?

TODO ANSWER

2. I have installed a python library (or vim plugin) but the system doesn't see it. It says "no module named 'modulename'".

This is because JuJu need to update the PYTHONPATH or the vim runtimepath with the new directories created after the
installation of the package.
To get it updated just re-source jujuenv:

    $> source ~/.jujup/lib/juju/jujuenv
